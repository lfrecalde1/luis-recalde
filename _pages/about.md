<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
 I am a young engineer and researcher specializing in Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The last few years I have been working in the way to combine control theory and machine learning.
 I became fascinated by the challenges of controlling complex dynamic systems in real-time using optimization techniques.
 </p>

The Beginning 
======
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering, where I developed a deep understanding of control systems and optimization techniques. 
Driven by my curiosity, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Control Systems Engineering in the University of San Juan Argentina. 
 </p>


Break Point
======
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
During this time that I encountered the emerging field of NMPC, which provided a powerful framework for controlling nonlinear and constrained systems. The elegance and effectiveness of NMPC captured my interest, and I became determined to explore its potential further.

I started delving into Reinforcement Learning, a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions in dynamic environments. Then I recognized the immense potential of RL in developing intelligent control algorithms that could adapt and learn from experience.

Present
======
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Equipped with a strong foundation in control theory and a growing expertise in machine learning, I embarked on my doctoral research journey, focusing on developing novel NMPC algorithms that leveraged RL techniques for optimization and decision-making.
