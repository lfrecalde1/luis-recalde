2023-07-14	Neural Network-Based Self-tuning Kinematic Control and Dynamic Compensation for Mobile Robots	 Proceedings of 10th International Conference on Mechatronics and Control Engineering 	This paper proposes a neural network-based self-tuning kinematic controller and dynamic compensation for tracking trajectories, which applied, e.g., in cases where mobile robots are subject to: continuous parametric changes; different trajectories and external disturbances where online gain tuning is a desirable choice. For this kind of controller, the kinematic and dynamic model was developed considering that the mobile robot is confirmed by differential platform, and the operating point is not located at the center of wheel’s axes. The artificial neural network estimates the states of the mobile robot while the gradient descent optimization algorithm adjusts the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error, the dynamic model is used to compensate the velocity errors in the robot. Moreover, the stability of the proposed controller is demonstrated analytically. Finally, simulation results are given considering a Turtlebot3 mobile robot, real-time experiments are implemented in the same mobile robot, where the tests are carried out to show the effectiveness of the controller in a real environment.

2023-02-20	A Comparative Study between NMPC and Baseline Feedback Controllers for UAV Trajectory Tracking	Conceptual Design, Modeling, and Control Strategies of Drones-II	Transport, rescue, search, surveillance, and disaster relief tasks are some applications that can be developed with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where accurate trajectory tracking is a crucial property to operate in a cluttered environment or under uncertainties. However, this is challenging due to high nonlinear dynamics, system constraints, and uncertainties presented in cluttered environments. Hence, uncertainties in the form of unmodeled dynamics, aerodynamic effects, and external disturbances such as wind can produce unstable feedback control schemes, introducing significant positional tracking errors. This work presents a detailed comparative study between controllers such as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and non-predictive baseline feedback controllers, with particular attention to tracking accuracy and computational efficiency. The development of the non-predictive feedback controller schemes was divided into inverse differential kinematics and inverse dynamic compensation of the aerial vehicle. The design of the two controllers uses the mathematical model of UAV and nonlinear control theory, guaranteeing a low computational cost and an asymptotically stable algorithm. The NMPC formulation was developed considering system constraints, where the simplified dynamic model was included; additionally, the boundaries in control actions and a candidate Lyapunov function guarantees the stability of the control structure. Finally, this work uses the commercial simulator DJI brand and DJI Matrice 100 UAV in real-world experiments, where the NMPC shows a reduction in tracking error, indicating the advantages of this formulation.
