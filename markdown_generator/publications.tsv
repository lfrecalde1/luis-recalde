For this kind of controller, the kinematic and dynamic model was developed considering that the mobile robot is confirmed by differential platform, and the operating point is not located at the center of wheelâ€™s axes. The artificial neural network estimates the states of the mobile robot while the gradient descent optimization algorithm adjusts the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error, the dynamic model is used to compensate the velocity errors in the robot. Moreover, the stability of the proposed controller is demonstrated analytically. Finally, simulation results are given considering a Turtlebot3 mobile robot, real-time experiments are implemented in the same mobile robot, where the tests are carried out to show the effectiveness of the controller in a real environment.
