For this kind of controller, the kinematic and dynamic model was developed considering that the mobile robot is confirmed by differential platform, and the operating point is not located at the center of wheel’s axes. The artificial neural network estimates the states of the mobile robot while the gradient descent optimization algorithm adjusts the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error, the dynamic model is used to compensate the velocity errors in the robot. Moreover, the stability of the proposed controller is demonstrated analytically. Finally, simulation results are given considering a Turtlebot3 mobile robot, real-time experiments are implemented in the same mobile robot, where the tests are carried out to show the effectiveness of the controller in a real environment.\tRecalde, L.F., Guevara, B.S., Zea, D.J., Andaluz, V.H.

      "2023-02-20\tA Comparative Study between NMPC and Baseline Feedback Controllers for UAV Trajectory Tracking\tConceptual Design, Modeling, and Control Strategies of Drones-II\tTransport, rescue, search, surveillance, and disaster relief tasks are some applications that can be developed with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where accurate trajectory tracking is a crucial property to operate in a cluttered environment or under uncertainties. However, this is challenging due to high nonlinear dynamics, system constraints, and uncertainties presented in cluttered environments. Hence, uncertainties in the form of unmodeled dynamics, aerodynamic effects, and external disturbances such as wind can produce unstable feedback control schemes, introducing significant positional tracking errors. This work presents a detailed comparative study between controllers such as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and non-predictive baseline feedback controllers, with particular attention to tracking accuracy and computational efficiency. The development of the non-predictive feedback controller schemes was divided into inverse differential kinematics and inverse dynamic compensation of the aerial vehicle. The design of the two controllers uses the mathematical model of UAV and nonlinear control theory, guaranteeing a low computational cost and an asymptotically stable algorithm. The NMPC formulation was developed considering system constraints, where the simplified dynamic model was included; additionally, the boundaries in control actions and a candidate Lyapunov function guarantees the stability of the control structure. Finally, this work uses the commercial simulator DJI brand and DJI Matrice 100 UAV in real-world experiments, where the NMPC shows a reduction in tracking error, indicating the advantages of this formulation.\tGuevara, B.S.; Recalde, L.F.; Varela-Aldás, J.; Andaluz, V.H.; Gandolfo, D.C.; Toibero, J.M.

      "2022-11-01\tConstrained Visual Servoing of Quadrotors Based on Model Predictive Control\tIFAC-PapersOnLine\tOne of the main issues of visual servoing schemes occurs when the target objects leave out the field of view (FOV) of the camera, which causes failure or poor performance of the controller. Solving this problem can be a challenge due to traditional controllers cannot include system's constraints. This work presents model predictive control (MPC) for constrained image-based visual servoing (IBVS) applied in quadrotors, considering constraints in FOV and restrictions in the control actions. To handle with image constraints the MPC considers: (1) the target objects stay only in camera's FOV and this work converts these restrictions in state constraints, (2) merge image instantaneous kinematics and the dynamic of commercial quadrotors (Mavic Pro 2) in a general mathematical model in order to satisfy the bounded control actions and image constraints. Due to commercial quadrotors allow velocities like control inputs, this work considers the reduced dynamic model in general velocities space and it was identified using Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) algorithm. This work uses Webots to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller. Finally the controller is compared with a classical IBVS scheme in order to verify the efficacy of the proposed controller and systematically evaluate the performance considering the system constraints.\tLuis F.

      "2022-06-22\tSystem Identification and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Collision Avoidance Applied in Hexacopters UAVs\tRobotic Systems and Automatic Control: Mathematical Models, Technologies, Applications and Challenges)\tAccurate trajectory tracking is a critical property of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to system nonlinearities, under-actuated properties and constraints. Specifically, the use of unmanned rotorcrafts with accuracy trajectory tracking controllers in dynamic environments has the potential to improve the fields of environment monitoring, safety, search and rescue, border surveillance, geology and mining, agriculture industry, and traffic control. Monitoring operations in dynamic environments produce significant complications with respect to accuracy and obstacles in the surrounding environment and, in many cases, it is difficult to perform even with state-of-the-art controllers. This work presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with collision avoidance for hexacopters’ trajectory tracking in dynamic environments, as well as shows a comparative study between the accuracies of the Euler–Lagrange formulation and the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) models in order to find the precise representation of the system dynamics. The proposed controller includes limits on the maneuverability velocities, system dynamics, obstacles and the tracking error in the optimization control problem (OCP). In order to show the good performance of this control proposal, computational simulations and real experiments were carried out using a six rotary-wind unmanned aerial vehicle (hexacopter—DJI MATRICE 600). The experimental results prove the good performance of the predictive scheme and its ability to regenerate the optimal control policy.

However, this can be a challenge due to high nonlinearities of the systems, environment’s obstacles and constraints in control actions. This article presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for tracking a variety of trajectories using multiple quadrotors in a unknown environment with dynamic and static obstacles. The controller is formulated using kinematic and dynamic models of multiple commercial aerial robots (Mavic Pro 2), actuators limitations, and finally converting obstacles objects to states constraints. It was developed through CasADI, an open-source software for numerical optimization that provides a fast solution to keep each quadrotor on the desired trajectory while nonlinear constraints guarantee collision avoidance and smooth control signals. The controller is implemented in simulations to systematically evaluate the performance, considering tracking accuracy and computational time. The results of the simulations are presented to confirm that the proposed NMPC generates a smooth control values ensuring safe states for each aerial robot while following a desired trajectory in unknown environment.\t\"L.

The integration of robotic systems in areas of assistance and rehabilitation improves the user’s quality of life. In this context, this article presents a proposal for the unified control of a robotic standing wheelchair. Considering primary and secondary tasks as control objectives, the system performs tasks autonomously and the change of position and orientation can be performed at any time. The development of the control scheme was divided in two parts: (i) kinematic controller to solve the desired motion problem; and (ii) dynamic compensation of the standing wheelchair–human system. The design of the two controllers considers the theory of linear algebra, proposing a low computational cost and an asymptotically stable algorithm, without disturbances. The stability and robustness analysis of the system is performed by analyzing the evolution of the control errors in each sampling period.

      "excerpt: 'Transport, rescue, search, surveillance, and disaster relief tasks are some applications that can be developed with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where accurate trajectory tracking is a crucial property to operate in a cluttered environment or under uncertainties. However, this is challenging due to high nonlinear dynamics, system constraints, and uncertainties presented in cluttered environments. Hence, uncertainties in the form of unmodeled dynamics, aerodynamic effects, and external disturbances such as wind can produce unstable feedback control schemes, introducing significant positional tracking errors. This work presents a detailed comparative study between controllers such as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and non-predictive baseline feedback controllers, with particular attention to tracking accuracy and computational efficiency. The development of the non-predictive feedback controller schemes was divided into inverse differential kinematics and inverse dynamic compensation of the aerial vehicle. The design of the two controllers uses the mathematical model of UAV and nonlinear control theory, guaranteeing a low computational cost and an asymptotically stable algorithm. The NMPC formulation was developed considering system constraints, where the simplified dynamic model was included; additionally, the boundaries in control actions and a candidate Lyapunov function guarantees the stability of the control structure. Finally, this work uses the commercial simulator DJI brand and DJI Matrice 100 UAV in real-world experiments, where the NMPC shows a reduction in tracking error, indicating the advantages of this formulation.'\r\n",
