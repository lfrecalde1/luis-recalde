excerpt: ' Dynamic Simulation and Kinematic Control for Autonomous Driving in Automobile Robots Danny J. Zea, Bryan S. Guevara, Luis F. Recalde &amp; Víctor H. Andaluz  Conference paper First Online: 19 December 2020 429 Accesses  3 Citations  Part of the Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing book series (AISC,volume 1302)  Abstract This article proposes a simple simulation methodology that allows to experiment with the dynamic behavior of vehicles, which applies control laws that allow automated driving in unstructured environments, through the use of robotic application simulation software Webots, which shortens the experimentation times of autonomous driving systems, It also allows to overcome the limitations that this type of projects involves, such as, high infrastructure costs, the difficulties of validating the system, qualified personnel and the participation of various elements with different dynamic behaviors that make up a real traffic space. The use of the virtualized model of a BMW X5 vehicle and the instrumentation of multiple sensors necessary for its operation are presented. Finally, a path tracking algorithm is developed using Matlab scientific programming software, and the dynamic behavior of the vehicle is evaluated through the response curves of the robot states, these results represent the starting point for future research and the implementation of physical tests.'
