excerpt: 'This paper proposes an optimal control to track trajectories applied in a differential drive robot. For this control, the kinematic model of the system was developed considering the position of interest as the center of gravity of the mobile robot. Additionally, the optimization problem with restrictions developed through the Sequential Least Squares Programming method was used to keep the robot on the trajectory and to find the optimal values. Moreover, the stability of the proposed controller for tracking trajectories applying optimal controllers is demonstrated analytically; this allows to prove that the control problem has a unique solution for the desired trajectory. Finally, the results are compared with a controller based on inverse kinematics.'
